# An iPython Notebook demo of ISA API

Simple iPython Notebook demos of the [ISA API](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api).

We recommend you use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) with these notebooks. To install Jupyter, simply do `pip install jupyter` and then run `jupyter notebook` from within the project directory. Make sure you have all the `isatools` package installed if you are running the examples that do everything locally!

* * ISA API example using tab/json conversion microservices (requires much more additional setup) - [isatools_edit_microservices.ipynb](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isatools_ipynb/blob/master/isatools_edit_microservices.ipynb)
