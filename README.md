# An iPython Notebook demo of ISA API

Simple iPython Notebook demos of the [ISA API](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api).

We recommend you use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) with these notebooks. First, clone this repository, and then to install Jupyter simply do `pip install jupyter` and then run `jupyter notebook` from within this project directory. Make sure you have all the `isatools` package installed if you are running the examples that do everything locally!

**The `isatools` package needes Python 3.4 or 3.5 so make sure you are using one of those as your default interpreter, or create an appropriate Virtual Enironment to run Jupyter and `isatools` from.**

* ISA API example using tab/json conversion microservices (requires much more additional setup) - [isatools_edit_microservices.ipynb](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isatools_ipynb/blob/master/isatools_edit_microservices.ipynb)
